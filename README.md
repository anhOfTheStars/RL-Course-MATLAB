# RL Course MATLAB
 Reinforcement Learning (RL) Course in MATLAB with exercises and solutions

This repository provides complimentary coding exercises and solutions for [RL Learning Roadmap][11]. The coding exercises format is based on the awesome [WildML Learning Reinforcement Learning course][3] by [Denny Britz][6]. Exercises focus on implementing algorithms (the meat of RL).

Given many RL courses in the community in Python, I create some coding exercises for MATLAB users. If you don't use MATLAB but want to follow [RL Learning Roadmap][11], rework these exercises in your favorite framework.

This is not an official MathWorks product. For online courses from MathWorks, see https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/.

## Table of Contents
Coding Exercises requires [Reinforcement Learning Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/reinforcement-learning.html) but you can always reimplement from scratch.

•	Chapter 2 - Temporal-Difference (TD) Learning (WIP)<br/>
•	Chapter 3 - Function Approximation (WIP)<br/>
•	Chapter 4 - Policy Gradient (WIP)<br/>
•	Chapter 5 - Advanced Policy Gradient (WIP)<br/>
