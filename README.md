# RL Course MATLAB
 Reinforcement Learning (RL) Course in MATLAB with exercises and solutions

This repository provides complimentary coding exercises and solutions for [RL Learning Roadmap][11]. The coding exercises format is based on the awesome [WildML Learning Reinforcement Learning course][3] by [Denny Britz][6].

# MATLAB Coding Exercises
Coding Exercises requires [Reinforcement Learning Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/reinforcement-learning.html) but you can always reimplement from scratch.

•	[Chapter 1 - Dynamic Programming](https://github.com/anhOfTheStars/RLStudyGuide/tree/master/Chap1-DynamicProgramming)<br/>
•	Other chapters are work in progress

# Why MATLAB?
There are many RL courses in the community but none for MATLAB users.
